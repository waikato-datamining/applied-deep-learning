Especially the use of Docker made it a lot easier and faster to apply algorithms to new datasets. If you have not used Docker before, we recommend you to have a look at our introduction called Docker for Data Scientists . The following domains are covered: Image classification Object detection Instance segmentation Image segmentation","title":"Home"},{"location":"image_classification/","text":"Image classification is the simplest and least computational expensive task, as it classifies whole images, assigning them a category.

The code is based on this Pytorch example: https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet Specifically, this commit: 49e1a8847c8c4d8d3c576479cb2fe2fd2ac583de","title":"wai.pytorchimageclass"},{"location":"image_classification/wai.tfimageclass/","text":"","title":"wai.tfimageclass"},{"location":"image_classification/wai.tflite_model_maker/","text":"","title":"wai.tflite_model_maker"},{"location":"image_segmentation/","text":"Image segmentation classifies individual pixels within an image, assigning them a label (i.e., a color).

However, this makes the algorithms computationally more expensive and more memory hungry.

The predicted locations are typically rectangles (aka bounding boxes). If you are looking for shapes or polygons, then have a look at instance segmentation .
