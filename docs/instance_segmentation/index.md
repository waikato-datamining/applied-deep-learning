**Instance segmentation** not only finds objects within images, it also learns the shape of the objects rather
than just a simple rectangle/bounding box. However, this makes the algorithms computationally more expensive
and more memory hungry.

Before you delve into training models, take a look at how you need to [annotate your data](annotate.md).

The following frameworks are available:

* [Detectron2](detectron2.md)
