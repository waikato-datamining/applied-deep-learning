While working on a number of projects over the years, we have developed (and maintain) a number of Python libraries
and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images that can be used for various deep learning tasks. Especially the use of Docker made it a lot 
easier and faster to apply algorithms to new datasets. If you have not used Docker before, we recommend you to
have a look at our introduction called [Docker for Data Scientists](https://www.data-mining.co.nz/docker-for-data-scientists/).

The following domains are covered:

* [Image classification](image_classification/index.md)
* [Object detection](object_detection/index.md)
* [Instance segmentation](instance_segmentation/index.md)
* [Image segmentation](image_segmentation/index.md)
