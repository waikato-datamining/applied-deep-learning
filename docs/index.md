Over the years, we have been working on a number of projects that involved applying deep learning 
algorithms to image problems. Setting up deep learning frameworks is always a slow and painstaking process,
getting all the library dependencies right (CUDA, cuDNN, numpy, etc). To speed things up, we have developed 
(and maintain) a number of Python libraries and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images that can be used 
for various deep learning tasks. Here we are showing examples on how you can use these images on datasets 
to train your own models and how to apply them.

The use of Docker made it a lot easier and faster to apply algorithms to new datasets. 
If you have not used Docker before, we recommend you to have a look at our introduction called 
[Docker for Data Scientists](https://www.data-mining.co.nz/docker-for-data-scientists/).

The following domains are covered with examples:

* [Image classification](image_classification/index.md)
* [Object detection](object_detection/index.md)
* [Instance segmentation](instance_segmentation/index.md)
* [Image segmentation](image_segmentation/index.md)
