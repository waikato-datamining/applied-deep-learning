You can use the [ADAMS](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) framework for annotating your images. 
ADAMS comes pre-bundled in various setups and we need the *adams-annotator* bundle. You can get either:

* [snapshot](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/download/snapshot/)
* [release](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/download/release/) (21.12.0 or later)

In the Flow editor (available from the *Tools* menu in ADAMS), you can load and execute the follow workflow
(which is part of your ADAMS installation when downloading it as zip file):

[adams-imaging-annotate_objects.flow](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-base/blob/master/adams-imaging/src/main/flows/adams-imaging-annotate_objects.flow)

When prompted, use *bounding_box* as *Selection type*.

The following video takes you through the process:
