**Object detection** detects one or more objects within an image and assigns each one of them a label, as opposed 
to image classification which assigns a lable to the whole image. The predicted locations are typically rectangles
(aka bounding boxes). If you are looking for shapes or polygons, then have a look at [instance segmentation](../instance_segmentation/index.md).
